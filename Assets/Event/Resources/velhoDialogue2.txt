Yarcco: “I have horses, not broblems... ”
Yarcco: “Oh shire! You scared me to death Bunny! Why would you do that?”
Yarcco: “You are almost as idiotic as my half-brother who got his ass kicked by a pony. Do I look like a monster to you?”
Yarcco: “You just got officially lowered to the same level with my brother.”
Yarcco: “On adventure? Can I ask where Bunny Baggins is going?”
Yarcco: “Please don’t say that you expect me to be your companion or something”
Yarcco: “I have always dreamed being an NPC. Press X to talk to me!”
Yarcco: “Press the X or I will turn you into a pinecone!”
Yarcco: “I have guidelines for your adventure young traveler. First: Thou shall not fight the monsters, thou must run because the monsters are too strong. Second: The respectable Judge Goldfish is a corrupted bastard”
Yarcco: You are welcome young hero! And by the way it’s Yarcco the Super Wizard when I’m mentoring someone”
Yarcco: “Farewell Bunny! I hope you don’t die before the first savepoint!”
