David: “Where are you going?”
David: “Basic Friday I would say. But if you want to know where Adri lives, I can help.”
David: “I’m your only Uncle and I’m not going to give you the information free”
David: “So son, you know my armor?”
David: “I lost it in a bet to Eylias the Centaur last time we were on a trip to Vegas. And we had a deal that I can get it back only if I could steal it back”
David: “Absolutely NO! We are old army friends and he knows every trick I have. That is why I can’t steal it”
David: “Great! You know where Eylias lives?”
David: “Oh yeah, I forgot…”
David: “Go on kid. One more word and I won’t tell you anything”
David: “Bye Bunny”
