Dad: :(
Dad: “I have a plan. We only need some explosives and a carrot”

Mom: “Harold! NO explosives!”
Dad: “Okay honey! So, now we have to go with plan B”
Dad: “You must find Adri, Xummosde’s ex-partner and current monk”
Dad: “I can’t remember, but someone in the forests must know. You should ask around!”
Dad: “I don’t see one! Get it see like C”
Dad: “Good, see you soon son!”
