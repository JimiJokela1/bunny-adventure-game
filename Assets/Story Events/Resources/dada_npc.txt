Dad: “Yes I am.”
Dad: “If I can interrupt your monologue for a minute, I have a plan”
Dad: “Yes it does. Plus, lots of action and combat!”
Dad: “Yes Honey! So maybe not combat, but you could use my jokes as a weapon”
Dad: “No they are not. But now to your mission: You must find Adri, retired attorney, and current monk.
Dad: “No I’m not. He was Xummosde’s right hand before he decided to retire”
Dad: “Yes. After a rough weekend, he was enlightened and decided to move to the mountains. It’s a shame that nobody remembers which mountain it was…”
Dad: “No, you dimwitted cucumber. You must go and talk to Diputs. He should know where Adri lives”
