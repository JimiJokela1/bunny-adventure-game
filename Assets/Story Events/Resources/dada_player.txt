Bunny: “What the hell Dad!! You are in real danger and you’re making dad jokes?”
Bunny: “Great! What should I do now? My Dad is and idiot and in jail”
Bunny: “Does your plan involve more useful jokes?”
Mom: “Harald! It won’t involve combat!”
Bunny: “But they are so bad”
Bunny: “You’re kidding me right now, aren’t you?”
Bunny: “And now he is a monk?”
Bunny: “WHAT!? So, I should climb every mountain to find some monk who could give me some wise words? Forget it, I will live on my own now”
Bunny: “All righty then, see you soon!”
