McBirdface: I’m your neighbor Birdie McBirdface, I assume you are Bunny?
McBirdface: I’m sorry that I must tell you this, but your parents are imprisoned.
McBirdface: “You know after the monsters moved into our forests, many of us had troubles with our incomes. At the time your parents got too may quickie loans and now they are in trouble.”
McBirdface: “I suggest that you go to the courthouse”
McBirdface: “Or you could figure things out and help your parents free?”
